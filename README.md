Building
========

Requirements:
- Windows.
- XDK (version 21256.17 is recommended).
- Visual Studio 2010.

Before you can build any of the projects here, you need to double click the 'AtgFramework2010-installer.bat' script to populate the source tree with some required files. Then you can open any of the Visual Studio project files.
